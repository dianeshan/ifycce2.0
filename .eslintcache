He is the ex-founder of Caseology, a\n                                    CPG brand bootstrapped from Zero to $144M in total revenue.

A lot of eCommerce owners start as a side job -- there’s actually no “eCommerce” profession yet, no major consumer goods, so it’s an interesting growing part of the business world. I’ve been doing it for 11 years, making products, creating value for customers, and fixing their problems. So, in overall business, I would say I am pretty experienced in problem solving. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you be more specific and describe what kinds of problems that you solved?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>When we started, I didn’t even know how to import or export consumer products, so I would get stuck there. All my products got held in customs, and I didn’t know how to get them out. That was a problem we had to solve. In addition, we had to solve capital problems because no one wanted to loan or invest in our consumer goods business. With no history, investors are scared of investing, because there’s too much risk that they’ll have to use all the cash on inventory. We also had to solve marketing issues; it’s not just about finding good products, but also how to sell the product. At the end of the day, any business has to solve problems with different perspectives. Do I look at this issue with an investor perspective, or a consumer perspective? We learned that my opinion is not always the answer, there are other people’s expectations out there. When we got stuck and didn’t know what to do, really believing in ourselves, that we were meant for this, helped us not give up. We’ve had many crises, like near bankruptcy, but we overcame them to even reach the top 2 sellers on Amazon. We’ve grown from zero to 120 employees. At first we were just ordinary people, with first time jobs and no background, but because we were professional and did what we needed to do, we’re not scared of any problems and are solid.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>There are many things you have to learn on the fly to be an entrepreneur, and that could be an intimidating roadblocks to people who want to get into entrepreneurship. Could you share some of your insights and advice on how you addressed these roadblocks?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Sure. So the thing is that, we can’t solve every problem, so we [first] categorize [our problem]. [Is] fear [the problem that we are facing]? Are we scared of trying it? Or do we really think we can do it? We call that faith or confidence -- in Christian terms it will be faith, and to nonbelievers we just use the word confidence, right? So I think it's really getting rid of the fear and really going to the visionaries stage. Do you think you can really do it when we start picturing? Sometimes, even though we don't have the capacity, we start picturing what it would be like and we start getting excited. [For example,] what do you think you would do if you win the lottery? When we think of the lottery, we start smiling and we're like, ‘Oh my gosh. I can win the lottery.” Similarly, we start imagining when we're solving a problem. A lot of people don't imagine what it would be like after you solve it, but we start setting that as the goal. Like making a goal for a problem, going backwards and not being afraid of failure because the plan doesn't always work.</p>\n                                    <p>The key thing was the way we treat failure. Do we treat failure like a failure or do we treat failure as learning? As long as we’re treating failure as the fuel or steps or learning, then there is no “failure”. We'd learn as much as we can and share the learning. Every time we learn, I think our perspective gets bigger. Sometimes, God is trying to teach us. Every failure for us has a meaning, so we try to treat failures as learning. [With that mindset,] the journey becomes more enjoyable -- we try to tackle as many problems, possibly learn and enjoy it because it's good muscle for us at the end of day, and we just take it a step at a time.</p>\n                                    <p>The other thing is, sometimes we have to accept the door being closed [by the Lord]. Sometimes we may think, “oh, if we do this plan then we can do that”, or “if I get this partner we can get big deals.” Sometimes it just doesn't work, and we have to accept that it is not meant for us right now, and maybe there is a different way. Even though we actually had the power to force open the door and get that deal if we really wanted to, sometimes God doesn't want that. Every choice that we make has a consequence or reward. Maybe we can force open the door and get whatever we want, but eventually we [may] feel the [internal] conflict. So I think these days, we try to make it more peaceful, natural and not forceful. When we include God [in our decision making], problem solving becomes more natural and enjoyable. We may think we are stronger than Him or think we are more capable, but that leads to feeling lonely later down the road. So we try to ask [Him] a lot. We are faith-based business, and God always leads us to every choice we make. When we include Him, we become more mature and we get to learn when we're in control versus when we want Him to control stuff.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={confidence} alt=\"confidence\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is the driving force behind your work? What makes you passionate and decide to pursue entrepreneurship, and particularly in eCommerce?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I think what drives me is the journey of faith. I learned a lot about why God mentions faith so much in the Bible. On my journey and others’, a lot of people forget what God does for them, or the help they receive. I’m really grateful for the change that happened in my life before and after this entrepreneurship. Before, I had nothing, even near bankrupt. I didn’t have a working permit, so I was basically illegal. I wasn’t actually good at anything, and my grades were pretty bad. I really felt like I was nothing, but now I’m completely changed. I can take care of the people I care about, and there are a lot of people who believe in me. I really believe that everything that happened was 100% through God, because I alone just wasn’t capable. So my driving force is that I owe Him my life. I remember what he did for me. I remember who I was. I remember the things that I overcame.</p>\n                                    <p>Thankfully, through that journey I learned His heart, and how much He wants people to have faith in Him. As much as I appreciate the people who believe in me, I learned how much it means [to God] when we believe in Him. You get to appreciate people who believe in you more than you believe in yourself. I think it is a very encouraging feeling that God wants to have a relationship with us, so I really believed in him and actually appreciated him. There’s this idea that God doesn’t pick the most qualified or perfect people, but qualifies the called instead. As long as you believe your call, you don’t have to be qualified or perfect. I really think my journey is a testimony to that, because I was nothing close to perfect. I was able to see through him and the business, it's pretty amazing because I wouldn't have thought of all these achievements or these ideas. A lot of the time, I really didn't come with the idea. It was like, it happened, and God opened the door. At the end of the day, [I just want to] remember what He did for me and know that I owe Him everything.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you share some examples of how your faith in God contributes to your work?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>You know it’s God when you get ideas that you never could have thought of on your own. You know who you are, you know how smart you are. Ideas where you think, “wow, this definitely isn’t mine,” happen when you ask Him. There’s a lot in asking God for help and for blessing, and then actually acting on what he gives.</p>\n                                    <p>At one point, we didn’t have any money in the business, so we had to close many, many times. Every other month or so, we were going to go bankrupt, but God would provide investment opportunities that kept us going. We wouldn’t be doing well, but we weren’t in fear, because God took care of us so many times. So we diligently and faithfully act as if we’re not going to close, because we didn’t get this far to close. Believe you’re on the journey; you’re here to impact. As long as you’re prepared and act faithfully, God gives opportunities. You know it’s God, because we didn’t send that email or make that call; we didn’t ask other people for anything, we only asked God. Then these things would come and keep us alive.</p>\n                                    <p>What was really helpful was knowing when it was God versus when it was you. It’s important because you have to glorify God when you know it’s God. Don’t take his credit. Tell people that there were things we did right, but it wasn’t you who made that call, it was really God. We might be afraid of how people will receive it, but just boldly saying that makes a huge difference.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What kind of people do you look for to join your team? What are characteristics for people who want to succeed in a startup or entrepreneurship environment?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>In our company, we look for people who know how to be thankful. A lot of people are just complaining about life in general, from the smallest to the biggest things. We’re drawn to complaining, so it’s very rare to find thankful people who make the most out of potential moments of complaint. It’s finding meaning in a bad situation, and deciding to be thankful. Deciding to be thankful when a bad thing happens to you is actually an active faith, and we look for that because we like to serve. We really care about serving others, and we expect you to serve as well. If you don’t know how to be thankful, you’re forcefully serving, and it’s not coming from you. Thankful people also create good energy and positivity. They also remember what they received and what we taught them.</p>\n                                    <p>The second thing we look at is how self-centered you are. There are very egocentric people that only talk about themselves when they’re in a group, and they don’t ask how others are doing. We don’t like working with these people, because when they solve problems, they only look at it from their perspective. They don’t have the listening skills to understand and feel emotions towards customers or partners. Very self-centered people can’t see beyond themselves, so we’re not attracted to that.</p>\n                                    <p>The third thing would be proactive and reactive action. We’re naturally wired to want to follow, but instead of being in an environment where you follow, can you be an environment where people will want to follow you? Even if they’re new, there are proactive people who are constantly asking. Asking itself isn’t wanting to follow, it’s wanting to observe, and you’re creating a shift in the energy. When you’re being thankful, serving, asking, and doing, as a new person, you create lots of positive energy for the existing people. Then we tend to shift to that person. We see the potential in them, we want to grow them, and we believe that they’ll create a good environment for others to constantly multiply in. We care more about wanting to grow, change and impact, and a little less about the skill sets. Of course, we need a certain amount of those skill sets, but we were people with huge drive, not just skill sets. So we believe in the environment you create first, and the skill you have second.</p>\n                                    <p>We also like people with good habits. Habits are very hard to break. We try to hire based on [the] environment [they create] or [their] habits, because through that the work can be learned. We can [always] figure out [the issues if it is just the lack of] the skills, but it’s a lot harder to [figure things out if the problem comes from the wrong] environment [they create] or [the lack of good] habits.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>The giving and receiving and positivity of your company culture fits very well with CCE’s mission as well! That’s a different perspective, focusing on the culture and people, which is really important since that’s who you interact with daily.</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Yeah. I just want to add a little bit. These are the things that will help us find who’s the right person for us. There have to be two things: the right person and the right seat. It’s not the right skill; it’s the right seat. If you know it’s the right person, we have to move them around to find what matches them in terms of skill set and the role itself. A wrong person doesn’t fit in any seat though, and we have to get them out of the company. They’re going to be a cancer to the company, and it’s just not going to work. It has to be the right person first, and if they’re right, there’s a chance we can find a different role or seat for them. That’s a lot easier of a fix than trying to make a wrong person right; it just doesn’t work. Shengming mentioned something I really liked, which is that we value picking the right soil. If it’s the right soil, it’ll grow really well. But if it’s just totally the wrong soil, even the best seed won’t grow in it. But sometimes, even giving a little bit in the right soil will grow a lot.</p>\n                                    <p>One person at our company was just like that. We gave them a little information, and he absorbed everything. We don’t have to give 20 hours of training, just a little, and he actually makes more out of what we learned.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How do you manage to balance entrepreneurship with your own personal life?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I’m actually pretty bad at it. In the past I would do everything that came into my lap, so the only choice was to sleep less and just do more, but I learned later that we get burnt out really quick. So I think we have to find what we’re weak at, and start making partners or hiring the right people that will cover those weaknesses. Now we try to do what’s impactful, and you do that by not making it perfect, so we can keep moving.</p>\n                                    <p>A lot of people want it to be perfect, but mini-progresses are what’s important. There’s this concept I really like that Andrew Wilkinson shared. People try to make a car, but to make a car, you need the frame, the engine, the pipes, the wheels, and after you’re finished, then you can go. Instead of that, what worked for us was to make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bike, then a car. You want to make progress as you go, instead of trying to make it perfect. We get overwhelmed when we do things that aren’t impactful, so we don’t make progress. We have to make mini progresses to get data; we fail and we fix. We need time to go through cycles of learning instead of ending up making one big fat failure. So instead of making a bold break, we should scale it down to a smaller version, so we can learn and keep making a more progressive learning path.</p>\n                                    <p>It’s also important to delegate as you go. One thing we learned is if you try to do everything yourself, you’re not going to get anywhere; you could go far, but not further. Knowing how to get there with people was key to getting there faster. People might say working with other people will slow them down, and that may be true, but you can’t get far without it. So we spent time training, teaching, and trying to find people that are like us.</p>\n                                    <p>Another thing that happened with time was that I cut off a lot of people in my life, and created a circle around the people that helped me. It was painful in the beginning, but you have to surround yourself with the right people. I think we’ve all heard that from somewhere, but I didn’t listen to it. I really valued every relationship I had, but I realized there were some that slowed me down a lot. Or if you spend less time with them, you don’t have to cut ties completely, and then you can visit or help them back. To give you an extreme example, I had to cut my relationship with my family, because they were really hurting me. But now I’m really close with them, and we’re way closer than before. All the scars are healed and everything is much better.</p>\n                                    <p>Knowing how to do that, delegating and being with the right people, is very helpful and balancing. If you’re tired, just don’t do work, and do what would re-energize you. Sometimes people say I’m a workaholic, and even though work makes me happy, if I knew I was getting in over my head, I have to stop. If you know something’s good for you, and you don’t want to do it, most of the time you should do it. Healthy food normally isn’t super tasty, but you need to eat it. I try to focus on what I have to force myself to do. We naturally tend towards comfort and laziness, but cutting those and doing what’s good for you, even if it’s painful, really helps to get the balance we actually want.</p>\n                                    <p>One thing we teach at our company is called “counter.” For example, we really care about giving back, but how much are we really doing to give back? So here is where we counter: “we know we care, but we’re not doing it. So we’re going to do it.” We analyze ourselves, and help analyze other people. For example, “I know you care about working out, but you’re not doing it, so let’s find a way where you’re going to work out.” So with “counter”, we try to practice the healthy things that help us. Other people don’t even have to ask you what you do and don’t need to do, because if you think about it, we already know how to counter ourselves, so we just need to focus on getting that balance.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"confidence\"></a>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for International Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I was born in Korea but went to kindergarten in Australia, elementary in Brazil, and then middle school in Korea. I went to high school in the US, but in between I went back and forth to Korea. So on average, it was rare for me to be in one place for more than two or three years. It was usually one to two, and then we kept moving to different places, because of my father’s job as an international trader. So I did have an identity crisis, as well as a language problem. It was hard for me to make friends I’d get used to. So when we went to the states, I asked my dad, “I wanna stop moving, I wanna settle down and make friends.” But since I was young, I don’t think I knew what I was asking. For us to stop moving, he would have to quit his job, and that would make us illegal. So we came into the states legally, and then became illegal.</p>\n                                    <p>I was able to go to public school and graduate from college without a Social Security number, but I couldn’t work without one. I was trying to be a dentist, and I didn’t know I couldn’t be one until later in college. That’s when I started working 5 jobs, like as a waiter or in a warehouse; any jobs that would pay me, since I couldn’t get a legitimate job. That led me to start a business. I had to pay a ton of taxes, but I could still start one without a social security number.</p>\n                                    <p>There’s always a way. I could have made an excuse out of the situation, but there’s always a way, if you just don’t give up. Like I said earlier, believing you are meant for something, and that you didn’t come this far to not have an opportunity, makes your story and your faith stronger. It makes you more capable, because you overcame more than what others had to. It’s a good challenge to have, and you’ll be a testimony to not having any excuses. I really think the people who overcome more will be more successful in general. The more issues, the better the chances.</p>\n                                    <p>I was also really bad at words, but if you can’t speak, you can’t be a CEO, right? So there were a lot of obstacles for me; I was Asian, I didn’t have a Social Security number, etc. But it didn’t matter; those were just opportunities for me to find a different path. I think that’s what made us rely on God more, since we couldn’t rely on the benefits. We had nothing which we could have done by ourselves, so we just had to keep asking God; there were no other options. The door He opened was better than the loan, it was better than anything. There’s always a way out. Asking God first and acting on what you asked is better than just having privileges.</p>\n                                    <p>The first time God helps you, it’s like, “wow! God, thank you!” But if he keeps doing that for many years, you just know he’s going to take care of you, and you become confident. Since God has opened so many doors for me, I’m more confident, and I don’t care if it doesn’t happen the way I want, because He always has a better door or strategy. Any opportunity or partnership you get will go peacefully, because of what I call, a bold, humble confidence. You don’t need to be cocky, but you have to have extreme confidence; it is or it isn’t. Faith and confidence align. With that, even if you’re a new person in a new place, that can still be an environment where you can make a difference. People can feel that positive energy and they’ll be attracted to it.</p>\n                                    <p>Sometimes people will just have things they want to look for, and if you don’t fit that criteria, you don’t have to be there; there might be a better place. Just know that you are more than enough; you are chosen by God, and you came here not to fail, but to make a difference. Have that confidence. People should look for you, not you looking for where you want to go. It’s a big shift, but I really believe in that. After seeing what He did for me for so many years and even to other people, I see successful people having that confidence and having that super strong relationship with God. They don’t always come from a huge successful background; normally it’s the opposite. So just have that bold, humble confidence.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"ecommerce\"></a>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for People Interested in eCommerce or Entrepreneurship</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>If you’re interested, I really recommend pursuing entrepreneurship. You get to find a version of you you never thought you had. It’s like being a parent, but fast-tracked 20 years or so if you’re young. Taking care of employees is kind of like raising a kid, so I started raising kids, my business, when I was 25. You learn to be mature and a leader, because you have to do business. Even if you hired people of a similar age, you just naturally mature faster in your position. You can’t act dumb, you can’t act stupid, and you know that because people get hurt. You become more aware, more responsible, and you get to learn the necessary survival skills. You don’t have to have a big business, but you learn so much in that position that you wouldn’t get in any other job. You might if you’re high up in a different company, but with entrepreneurship, you get to see all of it; you face reality, and you get that raw experience.</p>\n                                    <p>You’re on your own, but you just can’t do it alone, so I think that’s an opportunity for you to meet God. You get to experience and be with Him a lot more, and you just became this version of you faster than any other job.</p>\n                                    <p>eCommerce is interesting compared to others. For restaurants you need a recipe, to do any other business you need cash. But with eCommerce, you just need the right product and have a few customers. You can start it as a side thing, then make it into a main thing. You don’t have to know code, you don’t have to know design; there’s a way to start without being perfect. You can learn as you go on how to be better and how to make an impact. That’s why I’m still in eCommerce. Now I’m trying to help other eCommerce owners get to the next level, because I know they can’t do everything on their own for long.</p>\n                                    <p>So for entrepreneurship, first, you get the experience, but if the business does really well, you’ll get paid more than any other job. What I would tell my past self and every entrepreneur is to run a business like you’re going to exit. When you exit, you generate a lot of wealth. And to exit, you have to run the business clean, you have to make it investable, and not make yourself the focus of the business. Buyers like businesses where they’re hands-off, so they’re basically buying cash flow. To be hands-off, you have to know how to systematize. So with your exit in mind, you would run a standard of a good, healthy business, and when you exit, you basically get paid a couple years up front. If it’s a 4x exit, it means you fast-tracked four years. Then as you constantly build and exit businesses, you’re saving five, ten, twenty years of your life, fast-tracking faster than anyone else.</p>\n                                    <p>I’m in my 11th year now, but I didn’t know all that before. A lot of people told us to expedite when we were super successful, but I didn’t see why we should exit when we’re doing well. But then the debt crisis hit, so you never know what will happen. It’s like when you go to Vegas; you’re not going to want to leave the table when you made the most. But I think exiting is helpful, and when you do, you can really serve the people you like. You could buy Ferraris, but the biggest happiness is when you get to help others in a way where you would have never thought you could help. Definitely give back to God as well, and He will bless you even more.</p>\n                                    <p>Rick Warren’s testimony is huge. He gives back 90% and lives off of 10%, but his 10% is so big. He constantly practices giving and giving, but he also receives. He keeps getting, because God can trust him in serving others. With entrepreneurship, you’re creating your own vision. If you put God into that formula, you’ll see things you would have never seen before, and become some who you would never have thought you could become. We have our own choice, and we’re not building someone else’s empire. We get to build a part of God’s empire.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={ecommerce} alt=\"ecommerce\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>Could you give a quick definition of what you mean by “exit”?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Exiting means selling your business. In the US, it’s in terms of profit. Depending on the trend or healthiness of your company, businesses like software companies can be over 10X, meaning you get 10 times of one year’s profit upfront. Simply put, it’s annual profit times whatever multiple. If your trend is up and down, then your multiple is going to go lower. If your trend is flat, then you’ll get a little lower. If your trend is very attractive, then you get more. There are different ways to value businesses, but in eCommerce it’s 3-6, and it’s going up every year, since eCommerce is getting more and more popular. Previously there was no way for ecommerce to exit, but now there is. There’re always exits for software companies though.</p>\n                                    <p>Exiting could also include fundraising. When there’s fundraising, you can exit your shares partially, and you don’t have to sell the whole thing. Even restaurants can exit. Just make your trend healthy and stable, have a consistent customer base, and you can exit 2-4X, and fast-track.</p>\n                                    <p>If you get really good at it, you’ll realize you’re good at problem solving in any business, it’s all somewhat similar. It’s about the environment, the management skills, the organization, making the books clean, and knowing how to market. I would perfect one industry, and then go to other industries. It’s like buying a house, knowing how to fix it, then selling it. As long as you know how to fix the house, you could buy any house in the world. That’s what I call problem solving. If you know how to fix it, you can fix any business.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default TheBiggestHappiness;",["106","107"],"/Users/dianeshan/Documents/hacking/iflyyoung/website2.0/app-postgres-ifycce/ifycce2.0/src/components/Team.js",[],"/Users/dianeshan/Documents/hacking/iflyyoung/website2.0/app-postgres-ifycce/ifycce2.0/src/components/Home.js",["108"],"/Users/dianeshan/Documents/hacking/iflyyoung/website2.0/app-postgres-ifycce/ifycce2.0/src/chronicles/StemNotNerds.js",[],["109","110"],"/Users/dianeshan/Documents/hacking/iflyyoung/website2.0/app-postgres-ifycce/ifycce2.0/src/chronicles/ConstExposure.js",[],["111","112"],"/Users/dianeshan/Documents/hacking/iflyyoung/website2.0/app-postgres-ifycce/ifycce2.0/src/components/AppNavbar.js",["113","114","115"],"import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Navbar, Form, Button, Nav, NavDropdown, FormControl, Container } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\n//add logo to navbar!!!\nexport default class AppNavbar extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return <div className=\"blue-container\"><Container>\n            <Navbar expand=\"lg\">\n                <Navbar.Brand href=\"/\">I Fly Young CCE</Navbar.Brand>\n                <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=\"basic-navbar-nav\" />\n                <Navbar.Collapse id=\"basic-navbar-nav\">\n                    <Nav className=\"mr-auto\">\n                        <Nav.Link href=\"/\">Home</Nav.Link>\n                        <Nav.Link href=\"/webinar\">Webinar</Nav.Link>\n                        <Nav.Link href=\"/pastwebinar\">Past Webinars</Nav.Link>\n                        <Nav.Link href=\"/team\">Our Team</Nav.Link>\n                        <NavDropdown title=\"Chronicles\" id=\"basic-nav-dropdown\">\n                            <NavDropdown.Item href=\"/chronicles\">All</NavDropdown.Item>\n                            <NavDropdown className=\"dropdowns\" title=\"Oct 2020 -
