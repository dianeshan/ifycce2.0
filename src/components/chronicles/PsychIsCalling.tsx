                    Dr. Paul Wong is a Canadian clinical psychologist. He
                    graduated with a Psychology PhD from the University of
                    Toronto, and teaches at numerous universities across the
                    United States, such as York University and Trent University.
                    In his decades of career experience, Dr. Wong created
                    Meaning-Centered Counseling and Therapy (MCCT), a new
                    approach to psychotherapy, and he is also the founder of the
                    International Network of Personal Meaning and International
                    Society for Existential Psychology and Psychotherapy. He has
                    made an international impact on society through teaching,
                    research, speaking, clinical and consulting practices.

                    As a psychologist, I do a number of things, ranging from
                    teaching and research, to counseling and consulting.

                    It took trial and error before I discovered that psychology
                    was my calling. As a teenager, I dreamed of either becoming
                    a writer like my older brother, or an artist like Van Gogh
                    whose paintings I loved greatly. But, I didn’t feel like I
                    had the necessary talents. Once I studied psychology, right
                    away I discovered it was my calling. In psychology, my
                    talents and passion meet.

                    I first worked as a full-time faculty member, doing teaching
                    and research. But I was also interested in helping people.
                    In the early 80s, when the HIV/AIDS crisis occurred in
                    Canada, I volunteered to provide free counselling for the
                    LGBTQ+ community. In the early 90s, I took up the position
                    of Founding Director of the Graduate Program in Counselling
                    Psychology at the{" "}

                    . This marked the beginning of my switch from experimental
                    research to clinical psychology, where I developed my
                    meaning-centered approach to therapy.

                    I took the usual route of completing an Honors Degree in

                    academic journey unusual was that, for various personal
                    reasons, I didn’t start my first year until I was 29. My

                    time of an average student.

                    I am not the best person to advise young people on how to
                    make the most out of college, because as a mature student, I
                    was much older than other students. Furthermore, I had to
                    take more courses per semester in order to complete my
                    degree program fast. Therefore, I missed the opportunity of
                    taking part in various campus activities. However, I do
                    advise college students to take part in both volunteer work
                    and various university clubs. Such activities not only
                    enrich their lives but also give them a better chance to be
                    accepted by top universities.

                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    I also have advice for people who are interested in medical
                    school. There are many aspects of medicine that are very
                    different from what ordinary people imagine a medical career
                    to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or
                    finding cures for cancer are not going to be a major part of
                    your training, and your hospital volunteering experiences
                    will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare
                    worker. A huge aspect of medicine is having to communicate
                    terrible news to an already shattered family. As you get
                    more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking
                    care of a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn
                    out by seemingly trivial details that actually become huge
                    roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance
                    status, bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or
                    missing family members who hold the power to make decisions
                    for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical
                    school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are
                    admitted.
