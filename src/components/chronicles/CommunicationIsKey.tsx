                  <p>
                    Bindu Therthala currently works as the director of software
                    engineering at Quantenna Communication within their
                    connectivity solution division. She teamed up with fellow
                    software engineers co-workers in 2016. Her day-to-day tasks
                    include assigning people to projects and priorities. This
                    requires her to work cross-functionally with every
                    department: hardware, software, marketing, customer support,
                    etc. Her main role is to serve as a leader for her team and
                    deliver Wi-Fi products by writing firmware for their
                    computer chips. She is also responsible for planning,
                    monitoring, and delivering a product. So for the hardware
                    team, she helps solve problems in regards to optimizing
                    performance of their network security. With the insurance
                    team, she checks in with the quality control team to make
                    sure the product meets certain standards. Finally, she
                    acquires customer service data – e.g., customer usage and
                    feedback – and incorporates what she finds in the passage of
                    their work at Quantenna Communication.

                      start-ups? What motivates you to do what you are doing

                  <p>
                    Number one driving force is passion, or simply wanting to
                    make a difference in the world no matter how small. In her
                    case, she said, “you must make sure that the company’s
                    mission is well aligned with your goals in a start-up”. She
                    found a purpose working for start-up companies. First, it
                    gave her the opportunity to explore and contribute to the
                    creation of many technological products/services. Over
                    decades of exploring, she specializes with connective
                    devices as they were the most important piece of technology
                    for daily life. In Bindu’s words, she believes that everyone
                    views connective devices more and more of a necessity that
                    you cannot live without. From smartphones to navigating
                    Google Maps to mobile transactions, the rapid evolution of
                    software has exponentially grown the field and her role at
                    start-up companies has become significantly more important
                    over that time period. Second, she learned that if you are
                    working in an environment free of work politics, there is a
                    mentality to always question the status quo. Bindu
                    appreciates how exploring new technology advancement has
                    given way to more opportunities. Whether it's solving
                    product issues or working with smarter people, what seems to
                    motivate her is the opportunity to expand her deep knowledge
                    in connective technology every day at work.

                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Bindu was born in India and she learned quickly that there
                    was an emphasis in engineering and medicine. She decided to
                    pursue engineering for multiple reasons: interest, family
                    influence (dad and sister were both engineers), and a chance
                    encounter. Bindu had always excelled in math and had a knack
                    for solving problems, but in 8th grade, she first
                    encountered a computer at school. In primary school, she
                    knew of the existence of programming languages and
                    electronics, but had little exposure to the field. However,
                    since that fateful encounter, it felt as if she had found
                    her career and has never looked back. Her journey started as
                    a major in electrical engineering at Bangalore University
                    but transferred into computer engineering. Since then, she
                    has continued to be enthralled by technology and followed in
                    the footsteps of her family to become an engineer.

                  <p>
                    When Bindu was in her final undergraduate year, the dot-com
                    era had just started and there was this internet explosion
                    at the time. It was the perfect time to be hired for her
                    first full-time job as a software engineer at Global R&D.
                    She was quickly introduced to everything from new software
                    to expanding her knowledge of coding. Bindu shared with me
                    how important it is to find work experience outside of
                    school as she had been thrown into the fire and was
                    challenged early on at that position. She was lucky to have
                    close mentors and experienced colleagues who recognized her
                    hard work ethic and willingness to learn. They helped propel
                    her career far quicker than she could have achieved herself
                    and now serves as a director like her mentors before her.
                    Lesson here is to always go the extra mile, as others will
                    recognize your hard work and it will exponentially grow your
                    skills.

                    Earlier in her career, Bindu was convinced by a male
                    colleague to start a software company specialized in
                    connective technology as she was young and had no outside
                    commitment other than work. This allowed her to commit her
                    entire time to rising up the ranks and helped each of her
                    first few start-ups go public. During this period of
                    transition, she learned that you should never feel like you
                    need to reach a destination, but instead be open to learning
                    or in the case of software engineers building skill over
                    years of hard work.

                      In your view, what are some characteristics you appreciate
                      working at a startup?

                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    First, an idea that challenges the status quo. There is
                    always a risk involved because there is no tangible result.
                    However, Bindu believes that risk is something that has
                    always attracted her to a company. Second, since a startup
                    company requires a team of highly qualified individuals,
                    they should not feel afraid to voice your opinion. It’s a
                    significantly different environment from working in a Big
                    Tech company with 3000 employees in one department because
                    your voice and ideas are recognized. Third, you are
                    responsible for many different roles within a startup. On
                    one day you may be responsible for engineering; on the
                    second day may be quality insurance; on the third day you
                    may be troubleshooting for a client using your product.
                    Fourth, the bureaucracy is very limited, so you do not have
                    to be assigned to a ten-man team or get approval from five
                    other departments. It lessens the hoops you must jump
                    through and Bindu very much appreciates that. Finally, she
                    appreciates the culture as start-ups offer a very casual and
                    inviting work environment. These are all critical components
                    that help her decide whether she would like to work at a
                    particular start-up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Start-ups present many challenges in the work catalog, but
                    the majority of employees who end up working for them
                    embrace those challenges. Key characteristics that make up
                    an employee at a start-up include the ability to be a
                    self-starter. This means being able to jump-start a project
                    or initiate work without anyone else having to inform you.
                    Knowing your role is key in this situation as your knowledge
                    from past work experience will be tested, but self-starters
                    tend to flourish in these scenarios. Second, start-up
                    employees tend to enjoy the freedom and ability to make
                    their own decisions. Bindu goes on to explain how working in
                    a large company means many tasks are assigned, and they do
                    not offer the flexibility but rather maintain control to
                    achieve overall success. A start-up company invites those
                    who appreciate the freedom of working on their own tasks.
                    Finally, an informal trait I noticed when talking with Bindu
                    is that start-ups often have leaders who do not conform but
                    are rather, in her own words, “rebels with a cause”. It's
                    clear how a start-up’s work environment is better suited for
                    her and others who share these traits.

                      have to say against this sort of notion, and maybe

                    If you were to join a start-up, then there will be many
                    opportunities placed at your doorstep. However, it’s
                    important to be realistic and realize that the end goal is
                    to be acquired or IPO-ed by an investor. Yet, Bindu does not
                    recommend us to take a job simply because you are guaranteed
                    higher pay. Of course, financial stability is important, but
                    she also said that a full-time job takes about one-third of
                    your day. One-third of your life is spent at the office
                    means you better enjoy your work or you will burn out sooner
                    rather than later. Thus, Bindu emphasized that we should
                    pick what we are passionate about, and then your commitment
                    will determine how successful you will become.

                    Bindu reassured me that many of the companies have their
                    struggles. Especially for start-ups, financial crunch can be
                    the difference between life and death. For start-ups, there
                    is often no machinery and financial stability is not
                    guaranteed, so there is a great deal of risk going off to
                    start a software start-up company. However, Bindu shared how
                    she views each challenge as an opportunity working for a
                    start-up. She took the time to share how one of her early
                    start-ups in software engineering had all the finances
                    covered, but the 9/11 attack resulted in supporters pulling
                    all their finances from the company. Yet, Bindu knew that
                    what they were building was way ahead of its time, and she
                    moved to California only to find the same prototype they
                    built at a showcase. They were able to get a deal with a
                    party that was interested and saved the start-up from
                    collapse. Bindu continues to share how difficult times
                    finding finances will demoralize even senior employees as it
                    lowers the chances for start-ups to be publicized. However,
                    each time she encountered that hurdle she worked towards an
                    IPO and got acquired for millions of dollars. Again, each
                    challenge can be seen as an opportunity to grow.

                    Bindu was most challenged by the language barrier. Her
                    experience in the US was filled with miscommunications and a
                    thick accent, as growing up in India meant she did not use
                    English on a consistent basis. However, she noticed that
                    places in the US are “melting pots” of cultures and many
                    were accepting of non-native speakers. Something that
                    remained consistent was that hard work was most valued, as
                    this is stressed to the extreme in Asian cultures. Bindu
                    learned quickly that communication was key: articulating
                    details, using analogies, etc. She continues to say that in
                    business culture, education is necessary to learn the
                    technical points, but soft skills are vital to your success.
                    In international countries, many of their schools do not
                    teach these soft skills, which makes learning these skills
                    on the fly very difficult. On the other hand, the US schools
                    seem to teach students how to handle an argument, lead a
                    debate, and master other soft skills before reaching higher
                    education. Nevertheless, Bindu appreciates the freedom of
                    being self-sufficient and enjoys the rights that come with
                    being a green card user, despite the financial struggle she
                    may have had early on.
