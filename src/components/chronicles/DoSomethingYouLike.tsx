                  <p>
                    Sure! I grew up in Taiwan, then came to the US for college.
                    I studied at Ohio State, then later on I got my master’s at
                    the University of Michigan. Throughout my student career, I
                    mostly focused on electrical engineering and computer
                    science. When I graduated and actually started my career, it
                    was 2008. It was a time of financial crisis, so it was
                    pretty hard to find a job. I had to do a complete pivot from
                    what I was studying, and I actually started my first job in
                    sales, focusing on networking. I joined Cisco System, one of
                    the leading vendors for networking, and I was in a part of
                    the sales associate program. That’s where I started my
                    career in the tech industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I did a couple of years of sales, then pivoted to a more
                    technical role as a technical marketing engineer (TME). The
                    interesting part of a sales engineer is that we go very
                    broad but pretty shallow in each area. There were so many
                    interesting areas in technology, like security, data center,
                    cloud, and I wanted to pick one area to really dive deep
                    into. That’s why I became a TME, and I chose to focus on
                    data center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After I did that for a couple of years as well, I realized
                    that I'm really interested in the business side. As a
                    technical person, a lot of the time I wouldn’t get involved
                    with how customers make decisions or how we take the product
                    to the customer. The technical folks would usually come in
                    after the sale was made. That’s where I really got
                    interested, so I switched from a technical role to the
                    product manager (PM) role, which is more focused on
                    business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, the product manager is like a mini-CEO. A CEO
                    owns the company strategy execution and the result.
                    Similarly, I will be responsible for pretty much everything
                    about a product or product line within the group. That
                    includes initial steps like identifying market opportunities
                    and finding where the product market fit is. How do we build
                    an MVP (minimum viable product)? Where will we be able to
                    get the MVP version to the customer? What are some of the
                    future features that we should make? How do we scale from
                    the MVP to more like a V1, V2? How do we bring this product
                    to the overall market; not just the pilot customer, but for
                    the larger enterprises out there? I’ve focused my career
                    mostly on the B-to-B, the business to business, not so much
                    the product from business to consumer.
                  </p>

                    I worked as a product manager for a couple of years. Then I
                    joined AWS about four years ago, because I’m really from a
                    data center perspective. Cloud is the future; everybody is
                    moving to it. [After joining AWS,] I’ve been doing similar
                    things as a product manager, but blended with some of the
                    sales skills I had in the past. It’s a blended role of
                    developing a product with the engineering team and working
                    with the sales team to bring it to market and ramp up the
                    revenue.

                  <h2>
                    <strong>
                      Can you talk more about what your specific role is as a
                      product manager in AWS?
                    </strong>
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    A unique feature of being a product manager at AWS is that
                    we own what we call product definition. This is asking the
                    question of what we want to build. The product manager gets
                    that initial idea through market research or getting
                    feedback from existing customers. If they recommend we build
                    something, and we see enough traction on the same request,
                    then we know it is something we should invest in and build.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once we get a sense of what the customer wants, we go back
                    with the engineering team. We, as the product manager,
                    specifically write a document called PR-FAQ (press release
                    frequently asked questions), which basically defines what
                    the product is, hence product definition. Other
                    organizations might call it PRD, which stands for product
                    requirements documents. The very important thing that
                    product managers do is understanding the prioritization. The
                    customers will always ask for maybe 10 features they want to
                    have, but we have to work with them to understand their
                    ranking from one to ten. A lot of the time we don’t have the
                    resources or time to build all ten, so we have to
                    prioritize. We use the term P0 to describe features [or
                    items with the highest priority], meaning that we cannot
                    launch the products without it. So out of the ten features,
                    how many are P0 functionalities? What’s the cost of building
                    them? It’s critical for the product manager to figure this
                    out, so we can help the engineers build the correct MVP with
                    the initial customer traction. In the next iteration, like
                    the V1 and V2, we can build beyond P0 to P1, P2, and P3, the
                    later priority features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The product manager also has to work with the sales team.
                    First we have to educate the sales team about what we’re
                    building: what it does, how it benefits the customer, and
                    the outcome they can expect to have. Actually, a lot of the
                    time it’s the product manager who’s selling the product to
                    the pilot customers. We show the benefit to the customer,
                    they’ll test it, and if they like it, they’ll adopt the
                    feature or product. After the product launch, we need to
                    figure out how to scale the product. As a single product
                    manager, I can’t talk to all the customers. I have to enable
                    our [sales] team to act like me and to be able to sell the
                    product. We also need to think about our strategy for
                    scaling the product. We could go to the sales team, the
                    partners, and maybe even other channels. There’s a lot of
                    thinking about business strategy and how to grow revenue. We
                    work with the engineering team to build the product and with
                    the sales and marketing team to scale the product. We’re
                    responsible for its success or failure overall; if it does
                    well, we get the glory, but if it fails, we get all the
                    blame too.

                    [People in AWS share a unique mentality. Although] we’re not
                    at the same level as a lot of startups, we often operate
                    like a startup, meaning that we’re early vision. We have the
                    early vision of the new product or service we should be
                    building, or a major enhancement for an existing service or
                    feature to make for our customer. I have the vision of where
                    the product market fit will be, then I execute it, and the
                    customers adopt the product. Not only will we be able to
                    bring in revenue, but the customer overall satisfaction with
                    AWS increases. Being able to visualize and translate what
                    was just in my head into execution is typically what
                    motivates me the most. A product manager is essentially a
                    builder, and you have to enjoy building things up from
                    scratch.

                    Product managers and engineers share some similar
                    characteristics; they identify and solve a problem by design
                    or implementation. However, product managers have the
                    additional consideration of the business side. If you look
                    at a lot of the tech industry, the product that’s really
                    successful at the end might not have the best tech from an
                    engineering point of view, but it’s the best in combining
                    the engineering and business sides. What a product manager
                    considers is, “how do I find a market fit where I can build
                    a good enough engineering product?” Once I have the initial
                    customer and can scale, I can continue to refine my product
                    and make it better.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s a different mindset from an engineer, where we always
                    want to build the best: the best code, the best hardware, or
                    the best car. But from a product manager perspective,
                    there’s a trade-off between time and what we build. What I’m
                    interested in is finding the right balance between a good
                    enough product and getting enough initial customers.

                    Machine learning (ML) is kind of a buzzword. Most startups
                    today will tag themselves with machine learning or AI to
                    some degree, but machine learning is still in its infancy
                    stage, meaning there’s a lot of open source things out
                    there. A lot of customers can stitch it together to make it
                    work, in a DIY style, and there are many different standards
                    across companies on how they do AI-ML. This is where we
                    think Amazon Sage Maker can help. Like how AWS was popular
                    among enterprises, the value proposition for Cloud is to
                    help offload undifferentiated work so you don’t have to
                    manage the server. You don’t have to own the data center, or
                    pay for power and cooling; we manage all that for you. We
                    provide the infrastructure or data center to the customer
                    where they can dynamically adjust it based on their business
                    need.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similar benefits apply to Sage Maker. Customers are
                    interested in building the model, validating it, then using
                    the model they’ve validated to forecast fraud detections and
                    increase their business value. But to achieve that stage,
                    the customer has to build a lot of things themselves today,
                    which are undifferentiated. They have to build their own
                    machine learning platform and standardize on their own best
                    practice, which can create a lot of silo. Silo means that
                    every department within that organization has a different
                    practice. What Sage Maker is offering is a managed platform,
                    meaning anything you don’t need to deal with. We manage all
                    that in the cloud infrastructure, just like how we give you
                    the benefits from the cloud as well. It really allows
                    customers to just focus on spending their time and resources
                    on building the model and algorithm, which is specific for
                    their application.

                    especially important in the tech industry, where you will
                    continuously need to learn something new. For example, I
                    needed to learn Cloud, then Kubernetes, then AIML, and
                    there’s always more on the horizon to learn. You also need
                    to be able to do this outside of a classroom setting. In
                    school, there’s always an agenda, a syllabus, or a professor
                    with you, but you have to be able to develop the skills to
                    really grasp and master new ideas on your own. In the tech
                    industry or any other STEM major, you can’t just rely on the
                    knowledge of your major, but you’ll have to have the
                    framework to learn outside of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another way to prepare is to be broad in what GEC courses
                    you take. A lot of the time people will just focus on their
                    major, but I highly encourage taking courses outside of
                    that. The product manager is a hybrid role; it is technical
                    and business. We work with basically all the different
                    aspects of the enterprise or organization, so taking some of
                    the marketing or business courses will be essential to
                    knowing these other functions. Understanding what other
                    people do and having some of that background will certainly
                    help a STEM student's success as a product manager in the
                    future.

                  <p>
                    The number one thing college gave me is a framework to learn
                    different things. I focused on my major as an electrical and
                    computer engineer, but I also took a lot of different GEC. I
                    had interest in courses like psychology, statistics, and
                    even some of the languages, like Japanese. It really
                    expanded my horizon and helped me develop that methodology
                    to learn new things, which helps me in my work environment
                    today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    College also gave me confidence. My undergraduate journey
                    was different from a lot of folks here. When I came to the
                    US for college, I didn’t speak English, so there was
                    definitely a steep learning curve for me. As a non-native
                    speaker, overcoming the language barrier showed me that
                    language shouldn’t be a blocker for me in school or in the
                    workplace. That confidence continues to help me refine how I
                    present, communicate, and connect with people.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    <strong>How did you overcome that language barrier?</strong>
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Back in college I was a member of the crew team. We would
                    train everyday, so I spent maybe two hours a day with native
                    speakers. I gradually picked up what they were saying, and
                    even started to be able to read between the lines. That
                    exposure to native speakers outside of the classroom really
                    helped me to pick up the language. But even after I
                    graduated, there was still a gap for me when I presented
                    myself in English. For me, joining Toastmaster was a
                    purposeful effort into polishing those skills. The pressure
                    of working also helped me improve. If I can’t convince
                    others in a sale, then it’s hard for me to keep my job.
                    These ways really helped me overcome that barrier,
                    especially being on the crew team; immersing myself on a
                    daily basis definitely helped me get a jump start.

                    I will also encourage STEM students to join a club, even if
                    it doesn’t relate to your major. You’ll learn something
                    that’s unexpected, and that could help your career down the
                    road.

                      What was your experience pursuing an MBA, after working in
                      engineering, sales, and product management for several
                      years?
                    </strong>
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    So there are two avenues for an MBA. Typically people do an
                    MBA after graduating; the golden timing is about three to
                    five years afterwards. They might do consulting, investment
                    banking, or financial services before then, but they’ve
                    identified their career path and they want to go relatively
                    quickly. Some folks want to be a product manager, so within
                    those 3-5 years, they’ll apply to MBA. Most product managers
                    in the enterprise world have an MBA, and while it’s not
                    required, having it is definitely a big plus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other route is for people who work for longer, like me.
                    I worked for almost 10 years before pursuing my MBA, and I
                    pursued that degree because I needed to know how to perform
                    my daily job. Coming from an engineering and sales
                    background, I didn’t have the training for pricing,
                    modeling, or forecasting. A lot of folks that pursue an MBA
                    much later in their career come from degrees unrelated to
                    business, like engineering, law, or medicine. After working
                    for a while, they’ll gradually switch to an executive or
                    more business-oriented role, where they’ll learn the
                    business discipline and new skills through the MBA.

                    Data scientists and business analysts are pretty hot right
                    now. There are thousands of these job postings, and it’s
                    definitely a great way to get into the tech workspace. But I
                    also encourage you to rotate around in your first couple of
                    years. People can give you their feedback and experience,
                    but it’s really up to you to experience it for yourself.
                    It’ll take some time for you to really find where you want
                    to launch your career.

                  <p>
                    I didn’t find the product manager role until almost five
                    years after I started working, and it took some trial and
                    error. I tried sales and I liked it, but I knew I didn’t
                    want my whole career to be sales. I tried technical
                    marketing engineering, but again, that’s not something I
                    feel like I will build my entire career upon. Then I tried
                    product management, and I really liked it; it was something
                    I could establish myself and launch my career upon. Some
                    people may have a very direct mapping after they start a
                    career, and that’s great. But I think the majority of folks
                    need that trial and error to really find their right career
                    path. Just because data science is hot doesn’t mean it’s for
                    everybody, right?

                    <strong>Tips for Looking for First Job</strong>

                  <p>
                    My path was pretty direct; I just went to school career
                    services. Typically most companies, including Amazon, will
                    have a preferred education institution they work with. Every
                    year, there will be an internship, then a full time job will
                    come. You’ll need to be familiar with what your school
                    offers regarding career services and what company typically
                    works with your school.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another path is mentorship. I didn’t do it when I started my
                    career, but I wish I could have. If you kind of know what
                    you want to do in your future, a platform like CCE will
                    connect you with a mentor who will be able to point you to
                    those industry specific events, groups, or LinkedIn to join.
                    You’ll get the exposure to see if you want to launch that
                    career and what you need to do. For example, what
                    certification do you need to have? What kind of courses do
                    you need to take?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides, note that certification is actually more important
                    than a lot of people think. One of the reasons I was able to
                    land my job at Cisco is because I happened to have a
                    certification in networking, and that really helped me
                    differentiate myself from all the other newly grads at the
                    time. We all focus on our GPA in school, but we don’t spend
                    much time tackling industry certification, right? That can
                    be a pretty significant differentiation, especially in the
                    first job or internship, since there’s no prior work
                    experience to judge applicants by. Having certification will
                    make your resume stand out pretty easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, interviewing skills are amazingly useful. Any
                    customer-facing role requires the skill to help the
                    customer, but most importantly to extract the main idea.
                    It’s not taught at school a lot of the time and the
                    importance of this skill is often overlooked.

                  <p>
                    Taking AP courses in high school is one thing you can do.
                    Computer science was harder for me in college because I
                    never did coding in high school. We were taught all the
                    theory when I grew up in Taiwan, but we never actually
                    implemented coding. Getting hands-on experience at the high
                    school level will be really helpful for college. I saw my
                    peers understand what the professor wanted right away while
                    I was still scratching my head, and it turns out they had AP
                    computer science back in high school. If it’s an interest or
                    major they want to pursue, trying out classes in high school
                    will definitely give a much faster start in college.

                    They’re very fortunate in the current time to have so many
                    online courses to take, like Coursera. Every online course
                    has a different target audience, so do some research to see
                    which ones are good for you. I recommend focusing on entry
                    level and going with a brand name in terms of e-learning
                    educators. When I came here from Taiwan, we didn’t have any
                    of those resources. I just kept going to office hours and
                    tried to figure things out; I think my TA really didn’t like
                    me because I visited so often. The language and the computer
                    science barrier was pretty hard. But international students
                    in the 21st century have way more options, it’s just up to
                    them to spend time and research. Maybe you only need to take
                    a couple courses, or even just a couple of bootcamps, and
                    you’ll get a pretty good idea of the language and computer
                    skills needed.

                    For folks interning in the tech industry, there are
                    definitely different ways to be involved in it; you don’t
                    really need to be in computer science. For every tech
                    company, there’s a need for finance, marketing, sales, and
                    engineering. At the early career stage, go broad. The only
                    way to go broader is to try different roles in an
                    organization or company. That will really help you find
                    something you like, and then be able to build upon it over
                    the course of the year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The worst case scenario is being stuck in a role you don’t
                    enjoy, but you’re depending on that job as your career is
                    moving forward. Something I always tell people is, you want
                    to do something you like. It could be a lot of pressure, it
                    could be a lot of stress. But at the end of the day that has
                    to be something that motivates you and that you enjoy doing.
                    If it is just an 8-to-5 job, that's not going to be
                    something you feel satisfied with. As your career extends,
                    the pay isn’t going to be the major motivation, but really
                    the fulfilment. The accomplishment will really be where the
                    job satisfaction comes from.
