                  <p>
                    At Facebook, I'm working on a team trying to build a machine
                    learning system to protect the content shared in the
                    Facebook community, ensuring that the ads are high quality
                    and don't violate fiscal policies. My daily work involves
                    coding, machine learning, research, product design, and
                    end-to-end solutions, including working with OPs, PMs, and
                    engineers. I have worked in different companies like Google
                    and Facebook and am interested in building machine-learning
                    models and applying them to a scalable system that can solve
                    real production problems. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can think of the end-to-end and back-end systems as the
                    whole processing workflow. Production data, like user or ad
                    data, includes data processing, feature extraction, and
                    running machine learning models to make predictions. After
                    you have the final decision, you show the final results to
                    the users. The data was processed from the beginning into a
                    system that leads to real impacts on the users. OPs have
                    different roles, like engineers doing the coding and design.
                    Program managers are called PMs and they work with engineers
                    and the legal team to make sure the project will meet
                    business requirements. They try to coordinate on gathering
                    resources allocated between engineers. For example, we have
                    a team of end reviewers. If a machine learning model
                    predicts that an ad is violating some policies, the machine
                    learning model can alert human reviewers to check whether
                    the ad is selling a counterfeit product, or scamming. Using
                    this information, you can decide whether this content can be
                    posted on Facebook or not. If we're not sure, we can have
                    third parties or invite reviewers to perform a final check
                    and decide whether this ad should be presented or rejected.

                    I oversee the machine-learning process and make sure the
                    end-to-end works well. The key point I want to bring up is
                    that working in the industry is quite different than doing
                    projects in school. When you do research in school, you just
                    focus on one area, find a solution, publish a paper, and get
                    some numbers. In the industry it is better for you to have
                    broader knowledge of the product, the business, and the
                    engineering. The research and experience you get from
                    university is only a part of it. The other part is how you
                    put everything together and how your work impacts the
                    company's business. The best thing is when you can find
                    something you are really interested in that also matches the
                    company's goals.

                  <p>
                    When I studied math as an undergraduate, my major also dealt
                    with computational mathematics, numerical analysis and
                    computer science. I decided to pursue computer science in
                    graduate school and I got my PhD degree here in the US. At
                    the time I just applied to companies and would join whatever
                    company made me an offer. I got two offers, one on the West
                    Coast and the other on the East Coast. I had already been
                    studying in California for four years, so I decided to join
                    Yahoo in the Bay Area for my first job.

                  <p>
                    The first job is really important. If you can find the first
                    job offer, that completes the transition from newly
                    graduated to working in the industry. You will learn a lot
                    from it. For my career, I found that I’ve always been
                    working in the area of fraud detection, anti-spam, and
                    integrity. It’s not really related to what I learned or
                    studied during my degree at UC Riverside, but for some
                    reason I just continued working in this area and was still
                    interested in it. For the long term of your career, you want
                    to find something you have a passion for, which may not be
                    related to your master’s or bachelor’s degree’s study.

                      had learned in school?

                    There is always new technology coming out, especially in the
                    software engineering and computer science areas. No matter
                    what you are learning at school, you will have to learn
                    about new things being developed in the industry. For
                    graduate or Master’s students, it's important that you have
                    a major, but the most important thing is that you gain the
                    ability to learn. That learning ability is really important
                    and will help you in the industry. I studied at UCR for four
                    years to get my PhD, and I feel like the process was really
                    helpful. You have to deal with struggle. You have to publish
                    your paper, you have to make sure it is accepted, you have
                    to improve it. At least for computer science, most people’s
                    work in the industry will not exactly match what they did in
                    school. But how you deal with these difficulties in school
                    will really help you in your career.

                      Do you think it’s better for a CS major to go into a PhD

                    It depends on the individual. If you want to gain deeper
                    knowledge in your field, you can apply to a graduate school
                    and finish a PhD degree. If you only want to work in the
                    industry, then a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer
                    science is enough. On the other hand, if you want to join a
                    research department in big companies like Google or Facebook
                    doing cutting-edge research, then you need a PhD from top
                    universities. A PhD degree is not a requirement, but it’s
                    also not a waste of time. You may spend three or four more
                    years doing it, but you're learning in the process and it
                    will help your career in the long term.

                    Every summer, there are many companies that have openings
                    for internships. Most people can start to prepare for
                    applying to these internships when they’re in their second,
                    third, or fourth year. If you are doing an internship at
                    Facebook and you’re doing really well, they can decide to
                    hire you directly after the six-month internship. For
                    Google, after an internship, you can do a very quick on-site
                    interview. Because you already have a mentor and a
                    recommendation letter, you will have a higher chance of
                    converting into a full time job. An internship is an
                    opportunity, so just apply to it. On the other hand, I was
                    also rejected by many companies. I got my first job from
                    Yahoo, but I was rejected by many companies too, so it
                    happens to everybody. Just don't give up. Just keep trying
                    and keep improving. Have a positive attitude towards the
                    interview. Don't take the rejection personally. Just try to
                    improve yourself every time, and pick out which part you can
                    improve: communication, coding, preparation, storytelling,
                    etc. Improve yourself from each failure, then as time goes
                    on, you will get the first job. Just stay calm. Don't give
                    up. I know the first job is always hard, but if you just
                    continue to do it and try, you will get it.

                    Actually, I didn't really do an internship in a big company;
                    my internship was from my PhD advisor. He was collaborating
                    with some local company, so I did an internship with them as
                    part of a research project with my professor. In that case I
                    didn't do an interview. My professor just referred me to the
                    company, but I still learned a lot, such as research,
                    MATLAB, coding, and design from that internship.

                  <p>
                    I'm not an expert on AI, to be honest. Even though I know
                    some machine learning, my daily job is not really involved
                    in that. I'm still doing some risk modeling with AI, but I'm
                    not doing the rewrites or the cutting-edge model training.
                    But I will say, one trend of AI is moving towards more
                    powerful computing. You can see that now with DeepMind,
                    TensorFlow, and PyTorch. High computing power will give you
                    much better results than what we currently have, and will
                    open the door for new opportunities that include cloud
                    computing, like Amazon's cloud computing. Another trend is
                    more on the technical side; there are new models coming out
                    to combine different data sets to train the model. The other
                    trend is related to mobile computing.You know cell phones
                    can do everything, but it still is not enough because of the
                    bandwidth limitation in 4G. Now because of 5G and 6G
                    techniques, your cell phone can be much more powerful which
                    opens up many opportunities for different applications.

                  <p>
                    I think AI makes people work more efficiently. For example,
                    Amazon uses AI for product distribution. We already leverage
                    robots and machines to perform automatic distribution and do
                    some of this easy work, so humans can just focus on
                    management and monitoring this process. You can see that
                    trade between countries now occurs at high speeds. In the
                    past, Amazon’s impact could only reach a limited group of
                    people over a long time, but now with these scalable AI
                    robot distribution centers, it can operate at much faster
                    speeds and can reach people globally. In the hands of AI,
                    work is more efficient. The other thing is AI is doing
                    cutting-edge research for health. Scientists are trying to
                    leverage AI to do cancer analysis, diabetes checks and for
                    problems in protein folding. For example, Google made a
                    contact lens that can help people with diabetes monitor the
                    glucose levels in your body. Before, you had to use a needle
                    and blood to monitor your glucose levels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In cancer and disease analysis, many experienced doctors
                    have to go over many X-ray films [or pathology slides] to
                    get enough results to determine if there is cancer. With AI
                    and computer reading technology, this can be done by
                    machines with higher accuracy. This makes the doctors’ work
                    easier because the machine tells them if there is cancer,
                    and the doctors just have to double check instead of
                    checking through thousands of films by themselves. The other
                    side of AI is the challenge that in the future if AI is
                    working in all areas, people have to ask, “How can I improve
                    myself to embrace these changes and to work together with AI
                    techniques to make my work more efficient and essential?”.
                    This is a big topic, including AI ethics, or how we use AI.
                    People are doing unbiased learning to ensure that the AI is
                    unbiased, and there are rules that AI cannot be used by the
                    military.

                    Since you're still young, you can try to do whatever you
                    want to do. The goal at the beginning of your career is to
                    get hands-on experience in different areas. It is fine that
                    you don't have the passion at the beginning, but as you're
                    trying different things, you're learning. As time goes on,
                    you'll have figured out what you really want to do. Someone
                    might say, “Hey, I really want to do something related to
                    program management, I want to talk to people'', then one day
                    transfer from being a software engineer to program manager.
                    That is very normal in the industry. I know some people that
                    transitioned from being a doctor to computer science. It's
                    very common to change mid-career. When I was at Google, we
                    had a medical professor from some university in France join
                    our team who just liked coding. Another engineer would come
                    to the office around 3pm, and work until 9pm at night,
                    because she was working as a part-time doctor in a hospital
                    in the morning. There are many careers you can do. But just
                    keep trying, you will find what you want to do. I can only
                    speak for a computer science major. For some other majors,
                    like in medicine, you will always have to go through the
                    process of doing a residency, then many years of practicing
                    to become a doctor. I see computer science as flexible
                    because you can transition to other positions. It might not
                    apply to other areas.

                    Even as I work in the industry, I still keep learning about
                    time management and what my priorities are. It’s hard
                    because you have to be committed, you have to have the
                    vision, and you have to do it every day. For college
                    students, if you can find a good mentor, which is what CCE
                    is doing, I think that is very good and meaningful. No
                    matter if they’re young professionals, or people already
                    working in the industry for some time, they can give you
                    advice. They can set examples that college students can see
                    and learn from. Also, try to go beyond the university and
                    get some real working experience, in terms of an internship.
                    You can learn a lot even at a part-time position, and that
                    can help you bridge the gap between what you learn from
                    school and the skills you need for a real industry job

                    Let’s say you are interested in literature, or physics,
                    mathematics, or various science subjects. These interests
                    will help you decide which major you want to study more in
                    university, and high school students can prepare for it. If
                    you are in high school and want to learn computer science,
                    you can do some coding projects and online learning to
                    prepare for studying computer science. I know some high
                    school students who can do projects on their own, like
                    making a mobile app. There are many resources out there and
                    maybe through CCE you can build these connections!

                  <p>
                    If you are already in the computer science major, focus on
                    the study. I know in US universities, the computer science
                    department teaches a lot from theory to real projects. If
                    you finish all the projects and homework with 100% effort,
                    you will learn a lot and you can also learn the really basic
                    skills, including data structures, introduction to algorithm
                    architecture, and other classics in computer science that
                    are really fundamental and that you will want to learn. For
                    other students that are not in the computer science major
                    yet and have additional time, I will say there are two
                    options. One is that there are many online courses like
                    Coursera, Udacity, and other online resources, where you can
                    get the first step into computer science. The other is if
                    you're still in university, you can try to audit or join a
                    class in the computer science department to see whether you
                    like it or not. After one semester you will get more
                    information and more of a feeling about whether you really
                    like this field, because there is a lot of coding and coding
                    theory in the homework. I think you definitely need to
                    expose yourself to the actual classes and do hands-on
                    learning before you can decide whether that's something that
                    you want to go for and to build a good foundation as you
                    prepare for a career in industry.
